# Second Stimulus Check Calculator

## About
The U.S. government is about to send checks — or direct deposits — to most Americans to help people survive financially this winter until coronavirus vaccines are more widely available. I decided to make my own calculator that helps you calculate your second stimuls check payment.



## Motivation
After reading a bunch of articles online to figure out how much I would receive, I rather found it confusing. Like me many individuals 
out there might still be confused, hence I decided to code this application 



## How it was built 
I used ReactJs which is an open-source JavaScript library which is used to build user interfaces specifically for single-page applications like this one.

My calcalutions were done based on the research I have done based on these sources <br/>
