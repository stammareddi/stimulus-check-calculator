# [Second Stimulus Check Calculator](https://second-stimulus-check-calculator.netlify.app/)

## About
The U.S. government is about to send checks — or direct deposits — to most Americans to help people survive financially this winter until coronavirus vaccines are more widely available. I decided to make my own calculator that helps you calculate your second stimuls check payment.



## Motivation
After reading a bunch of articles online to figure out how much I would receive, I rather found it confusing. Like me many individuals 
out there might still be confused, hence I decided to code this application 



## How it was built 
I used ReactJs which is an open-source JavaScript library which is used to build user interfaces specifically for single-page applications like this one.


My calcalutions were done from the information I have gathered from these sources <br/>
[Second stimulus check: Will you get $2,000, $600 — or nothing?](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-600-2000-dollars-eligibility-2020-12-30/) <br/>
[New stimulus law passed: Every major benefit you get, including a second check](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/new-stimulus-law-passed-every-major-benefit-you-get-including-a-second-check/) <br/>
The stimulus payment is covered in Division B of the  [S.3548 - CARES Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text)
